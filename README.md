Introduction
================================

Virtual Reality is, in the simplest of terms, a simulation of something that does not exist, in a very real
environment. So you can be taking a vacation in Vienna without even leaving your sofa.
The main purpose of it is not only to experience something new by vision but the user has the ability to control
with the help of sensors and motion tracking devices. Imagination and purpose together drive technology, it is
due to these that technology today is evolving at an exponential rate. Virtual Reality it is an experience of a
world that does not exist. It tricks one’s mind using computers that allow to experience and interact with a 3D
world. VRs displays are available in various forms, it produces a set of data that can be used to develop models,
communication, training methods, and interaction. In simple words, the possibilities are endless. VRs can be
classified into 3 types: immersive, semi-immersive and non-immersive.
1. Immersive VR system: Immersive VR system is closest to virtual environment, it makes us experience the
highest level of immersion, it provides the closest feeling of being in virtual world by using advanced tools and
gadgets not so common to use.
2. Semi-immersive VR system: Semi-immersive VR systems also make us experience a high level of immersion
bu the tools and gadgets used in this system are common to us and utilize so they’re not so advanced to use.
3. Non-Immersive VR system: Non-Immersive VR system is the least immersive, the gadgets and tools used are
limited to glasses and display monitors and it uses the least expensive components.

Unreal Engine
================================

In our project we’re working with Unreal Engine which is an immersive type of VR system, which empowers
you to build your team, your assets, and your workflow with tools that can deliver on your creative vision and
quality bar now and in the future. It merges augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality technologies
together to evolve rapidly and become more powerful. You start in the VR editor at a human scale and can
directly manipulate objects by moving around in a room-scale VR setting.

Project Purpose
================================

The main purpose of this project is to create an environment using drones for environmental monitoring,
with a smart mobility and civil protection.
Nowadays, the rise of VR has also had an effect on the world of drones. Specifically the art of FPV or “first-person
view” flying which has began to share significant aspects of VR technology.
For thousands of years, agriculture has played an important role in everyday life. That’s why The interest
chose in this project was related in the agriculture field which is a very important and huge field. It is a
natural resource that sustain human life and provide economic gain. It combines creativity, imagination, and
skill involved in planting crops and raising animals with modern production methods and new technologies.
A specific type of drone simulated in the agriculture environment equipped with a specific laser, flying above
the environment and stops under specific conditions to burn and get off of bad herbs fruits and vegetables and
leaving the good ones which normal people might do it, not in that perfection of course and will obviously take
so much time to accomplish it.
Drones in agriculture are numerous, it is one of the technologies that is driving precision agriculture which
improves efficiency, productivity, crop yield and profitability through the use of technology. According to analysts, drones in agriculture will be worth a massive 5 billion of dollars by the end of 2025.
It’s a powerful tool for farmers and agronomists to assess the health of their crops they can get an overview
of their fields and collect data much faster and more efficiently than traditional methods by seeing how healthy
their plants are, where they might need water or nutrients, and if there any plants that have to be burnt or
not. Noting that all these cases might be missed without the use of a drone and can lead to hundreds or even
thousands of dollars worth of lost due to issues that were not caught early enough on the ground.
